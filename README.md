# Roxiler System Project

## Overview
This project is a full-stack application for managing store ratings and reviews. Users can rate stores, leave feedback, and view existing reviews. The system includes authentication, a backend API, and a frontend interface for interacting with the ratings.

## Features
- User authentication with JWT
- Add, view, and manage store ratings
- Fetch and display store ratings dynamically
- Secure API with protected routes

## Tech Stack
### Frontend:
- React
- React Router
- Fetch API for HTTP requests

### Backend:
- Node.js with Express
- MongoDB with Mongoose (if using a database)
- JWT for authentication

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (>= 14.x)
- MongoDB (if using a database)

### Backend Setup
1. Navigate to the backend folder:
      cd backend
   
2. Install dependencies:
      npm install
   
3. Set up environment variables (.env file):
      PORT=5000
   MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key
   
4. Start the backend server:
      npm start
   

### Frontend Setup
1. Navigate to the frontend folder:
      cd frontend
   
2. Install dependencies:
      npm install
   
3. Start the React development server:
      npm start
   

## API Endpoints
### Authentication
- POST /api/auth/register - Register a new user
- POST /api/auth/login - Authenticate user and return JWT

### Ratings
- POST /api/ratings - Add a rating (requires authentication)
- GET /api/ratings/:storeId - Fetch ratings for a store

## Usage
1. Register or log in to your account.
2. Select a store to rate or view existing ratings.
3. Submit your rating and feedback.
4. View ratings in real-time.

## Troubleshooting
- If you encounter CORS issues, ensure your backend includes:
    const cors = require("cors");
  app.use(cors());
  
- If the frontend fails to connect to the backend, verify the API base URL.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement pagination for large rating lists.
- Add a feature to edit or delete ratings.
- Improve UI/UX with animations.
